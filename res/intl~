############ story - 1e, 3e, 5u, 8u, 10u, 13u, 15u
the spaceship, which wanted to stop you at the end of your journey, belonged to the famous pilot, general barrage. he entered the alien dimension first, and never came back again. you got a massage from him, after the battle: "the akatisians made me free, son. they rescued  me and my family from the miserable earth and let us to start a new life on a healthy planet. i've been gentle this time. next time we meet i'll kick your. . . i advise you to get away. but i am talking in vain, i'n it?" general barrage used to teach you at the academy before he had given away his soul to the devil. you hope you won't meet again, ever.
you have known the spaceship which stopped you all too well. it was the ship of barrage, a former pilot of earth's forces, first to be sent against the alien swarm, and was assumed dead since. despite you have lost contact with earth, a small red envelope is flashing in the corner of your control panel. it reads, "i'm gonna ask this once. get lost, or face the consequences". looks like he also recognized you. barrage was one of the best pilots earth forces have had, and you were one of the few chosen who have been assigned under him back in the days when you were just another young pilot-wannabe. what could've happened to him is unknown. and you don't even want to know. but there is no way back now; you have to continue your mission.
the mysterious ghost was constructed from the wreckages of the defeated mercenaries of earth. akatis has one again turned your own weapon against you. the spaceshuttle refitted with alien technology and weapons was a pure revenge for the damage you've done on akatis. one by one, it killed thousands of mercenaries until you put an end to it. the continous fighting has depleted the resources of your ship. you must return to earth to refill the fuel and buy more effective weapons for the next mission.
general barrage and you have clashed again, but this time, he had no way to escape; you watch the remnants of his ship disappear in the unfathomable deep. you feel real close to the alien homeworld now. you won't be met with a warm hug like barrage. you gave no mercy to anyone on you way. you must fight your way deeper in the enemy lines.
you've broken through the impenetrable blockade. at least, it was thought so. deep inside the alien world you're totally on your own. as you approach akatis, you known it's only up to your skills to get past the planet's defenses and complete your mission.
you've felt as if you had to fight against yourself. the newly rebuilt ghost's robot pilot has explicitly optimized against you! akatis has watched and recorded your every movement and now they tried to use this knowledge against you. what they haven't counted is that you outperformed your own self. with command center destroyed, forces of akatis are in chaos, crumbling before the attacks of earth's forces. you did it! as you leave akatis behind, the remaining forces of akatis try to stop you with one desperate move. you have to break through the blockade to escape!
at last, you broke through the blockade and made your way back to your home, earth. as akatis shrinks behind your ship, you think that maybe it is time to leave behind your past, too. with your rewards, you'll be fine until the end of your days. unless mankind would face such danger again... congratulations!
